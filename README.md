The Burns Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was created by psychologist Dr. David Burns in the 1980s. It consists of 33 questions that are designed to measure symptoms of anxiety. The questions cover both physical and psychological symptoms.

To take the BAI, you simply read each question and indicate on a scale from 0 to 3 how much you have experienced that symptom over the past week. The scores are:

0 - Not at all

1 - Somewhat

2 - Moderately

3 - A lot

Once you have answered all 33 questions, you tally up your total score. Scores are interpreted as follows:

0-10: Minimal anxiety
11-19: Mild anxiety
20-30: Moderate anxiety
31-63: Severe anxiety

The BAI is commonly used in research and clinical settings to screen for anxiety and measure anxiety severity. It has been shown to have good reliability and validity. It can be useful for tracking anxiety symptoms over time and assessing whether treatments are helping.

The test is not meant to be a stand-alone diagnosis. But it can provide insight into your anxiety levels. If your scores indicate severe anxiety, it would be wise to follow up with a mental health professional for evaluation and treatment if needed.
