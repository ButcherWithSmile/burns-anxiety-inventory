The Burns Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was created by psychologist Dr. David Burns in the 1980s. It consists of 33 questions that are designed to measure symptoms of anxiety. The questions cover both physical and psychological symptoms.

To take the BAI, you simply read each question and indicate on a scale from 0 to 3 how much you have experienced that symptom over the past week. The scores are:

0 - Not at all

1 - Somewhat

2 - Moderately

3 - A lot

Once you have answered all 33 questions, you tally up your total score. Scores are interpreted as follows:

0-10: Minimal anxiety
11-19: Mild anxiety
20-30: Moderate anxiety
31-63: Severe anxiety

The BAI is commonly used in research and clinical settings to screen for anxiety and measure anxiety severity. It has been shown to have good reliability and validity. It can be useful for tracking anxiety symptoms over time and assessing whether treatments are helping.

The test is not meant to be a stand-alone diagnosis. But it can provide insight into your anxiety levels. If your scores indicate severe anxiety, it would be wise to follow up with a mental health professional for evaluation and treatment if needed.

I implemented this test using Golang, a high-performance, open-source programming language that is known for its reliability and scalability. I then connected the results to PostgreSQL, a powerful relational database management system that is known for its flexibility and security. This means that you can access the previous results of the test at any time, and you can also archive them in a central location for easy reference. This makes it easy to track the progress of the test, identify trends, and make informed decisions about the future of the project.

Here are some specific reasons why using Golang and PostgreSQL is a compelling choice:
 • Golang is a highly efficient language that can be used to create scalable and reliable applications.
 • PostgreSQL is a powerful database that can store large amounts of data and provide fast access to it.
 • The combination of Golang and PostgreSQL can be used to create a robust and scalable test infrastructure that can be used to collect, store, and analyze data.
 
Here are some additional details that you could add to make the paragraph even more compelling:
 • The specific features of Golang and PostgreSQL make them well-suited for this application.
 • The benefits of using this approach over other possible approaches.
 • The specific use cases for which this approach would be ideal.
 • The cost savings or other advantages that could be realized by using this approach.
